$\huge\color{cadetblue}{\text{Pandigital divisibility}}$

<br/>

In this problem, we say that a number is *pandigital* if it contains all the digits from $0$ to $9$ exactly once. For example, $1023456789$ is a pandigital number, but $102345678$ and $1023457890$ are not.

The input consists of a positive integer $d \leq 10^7$. The output of your pogram should be all the pandigital numbers that are divisible by $d$. The pandigital numbers should be printed *in ascending order*, each on a new line. Numbers with a leading $0$ should be omitted. You are not allowed to use a sorting algorithm.
