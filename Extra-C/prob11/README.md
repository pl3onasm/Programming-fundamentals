$\huge\color{cadetblue}{\text{Anagrams for palindromes}}$

<br/>

Some word $A$ is an anagram for $B$ when you can rearrange the letters of word $A$ to spell the word $B$. For example, `inch` is a anagram for `chin`, but not for `niche`. A palindrome is a word that reads the same forwards as backwards. For example, `racecar` and `radar` are palindromes, but `banana` is not.

The input for this problem is a string of no more than $1\,000$ characters, which consists of a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters. The output should be YES if the string is an anagram for a palindrome, and NO if it is not.
