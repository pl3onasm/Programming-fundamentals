$\huge\color{cadetblue}{\text{Anagrams for palindromes}}$

<br/>

Some word $A$ is an anagram for a word $B$ when you can rearrange the letters of word $A$ to spell the word $B$. For example, `inch` is a anagram for `chin`, but not for `niche`. A palindrome is a word that reads the same forwards as backwards. For example, `racecar` and `radar` are palindromes, but `banana` is not.

The input for this problem is a single string (one line) of no more than 1000 characters, consisting only of letters A–Z and a–z. Uppercase and lowercase are considered the same letter (so 'A' and 'a' are treated as equal).

Output YES if the string can be rearranged into a palindrome (ignoring case), and NO otherwise.
