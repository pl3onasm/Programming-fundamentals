$\huge\color{cadetblue}{\text{Balanced brackets}}$

<br/>

The input to this problem consists of a string containing only the characters `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `[` and `]`. The string may be up to 1000 characters long and is terminated by a newline character.

Write a function that checks if the string is balanced. A string is balanced if all brackets are closed in the correct order. For example, `([])` is balanced, but `([)]` is not. The function should return `YES` if the string is balanced and `NO` otherwise.
