Prime numbers are integers greater than one that have no positive divisors other than one and themselves, and although the gaps between successive primes can grow, there are infinitely many primes as shown by euclids classic argument which assumes a finite list and then builds a new number by multiplying them all and adding one, forcing a new prime factor.
