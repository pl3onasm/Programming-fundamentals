In classical mechanics, newtons second law states that the net force on a body equals mass times acceleration, and together with conservation of energy it explains how a pendulum trades potential energy for kinetic energy as it swings, while air resistance slowly removes energy so the amplitude decays, yet the ideal model predicts a constant period for small angles.
